# Resume

Hello guys! I decided to develop a very simple website to talk a little 
about my professional experience... But that's all, in short 
I'm just a nerd passionate about computing 🤓

- Obs: to avoid environment problems, I recommend uploading with docker!

## Run API
Walk to the folder root

## Build container
```
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Build (front)
```
$ yarn run build
```

### Build (api)
```
$ go build -o ./{application}
```


### Run without docker (front)
```
$ yarn dev
```

### Run without docker (api)
```
$ go run main.go
```
